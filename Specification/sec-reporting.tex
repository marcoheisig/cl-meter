\section{Reporting}
\label{sec:reporting}

During reporting, the data within an aggregator is processed such that it
is useful for human inspection.  Several reporting mechanisms are
conceivable, e.g., via output streams, CLIM, or by serving the results on a
web interface.

Several things should be kept in mind when designing the report protocol:
\begin{itemize}
\item It should be possible to generate reports while the monitored program
  is still running.
\item When generating reports of running programs, the report should
  nevertheless capture a consistent state.  Some kind of locking is in order.
\end{itemize}
