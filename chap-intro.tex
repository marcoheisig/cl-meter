\chapter{Introduction}

\sysname{} is fast, precise and portable library for measuring the dynamic
behavior of software with respect to CPU utilization, memory allocation and
many other quantities.  The goal is to provide instrumentation that is
detailed enough to pinpoint performance bottlenecks or bugs, yet
lightweight enough that programmers can use it pervasively without fear of
noticeable slowdown.

In addition to the code instrumentation, \sysname{} features a sampling
tool to run a certain experiment repeatedly, until certain measured
quantities therein can be stated with confidence.

With our work, we consolidate several existing benchmark libraries for
Common Lisp, namely

\begin{itemize}
\item \textsc{Metering}, written by Chris McConell, Skef Wholey, Rob
  MacLachlan, Mark Kantrowitz and Daniel Kochma≈Ñski.

\item \textsc{trivial-benchmak}, written by Nicolas Hafner.

\item \textsc{the-cost-of-nothing}, written by Marco Heisig.

\item \textsc{cleavir-meter}, written by Robert Strandh.
\end{itemize}
